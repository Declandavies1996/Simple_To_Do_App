# Simple To-Do List App with GUI

This project showcases a basic To-Do List application with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Python's `tkinter` library. By creating this app, I have acquired fundamental skills in GUI programming, user interaction, and basic application development.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a user-friendly To-Do List application that allows users to add tasks to their list and view them in an organized manner. The app provides a simple interface for entering tasks and displays them in a list format for easy tracking.

## Skills Learned

Through the process of creating this project, I have gained the following skills:

1. **GUI Programming**: I learned how to design and build graphical user interfaces using the `tkinter` library. I became familiar with creating windows, buttons, text entry boxes, and list boxes to create a cohesive and interactive user interface.

2. **Widget Interaction**: I developed an understanding of how different widgets interact with each other. For example, I connected the "Add to List" button to the text entry box and list box, allowing users to input tasks and add them to the list.

3. **User Input Handling**: I practiced capturing and processing user input from the text entry box. This involved extracting text and using it to update the list box with new tasks.

4. **List Manipulation**: I learned how to manipulate lists dynamically by adding and updating elements. When a user clicks the "Add to List" button, the app adds the entered task to the list of tasks displayed on the screen.

5. **Event Handling**: I gained experience in handling user events, such as button clicks, and associating specific actions (e.g., adding a task) with these events.

## Future Enhancements

While this project demonstrates a simple To-Do List app, there are opportunities for further improvement and expansion:

- **Task Deletion**: I can extend the app to allow users to delete completed tasks from the list.
- **Task Details**: I could implement a feature to display additional details for each task, such as due dates or descriptions.
- **Persistent Storage**: I can enhance the app by adding the ability to save and load tasks from a file, ensuring tasks are retained even after closing the app.

## Conclusion

Creating this basic To-Do List app with a GUI has provided me with valuable skills in GUI programming, user interaction, and application development. I am now equipped to apply these foundational skills to more complex projects and explore advanced GUI libraries and design patterns in the future. This project has served as a starting point for my journey into GUI development and application design.
